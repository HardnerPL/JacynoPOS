# JacynoPOS

JacynoPOS is a point of sale system for restaurants aimed at working with small devices (like smartphones) and optionally printers.

## Getting Started

The application is still in early works and is not functional. It might have a lot of errors and glitches as well, or might not work at all.

### Installing

To install the application you will only need a PHP server with MySQL support, like xampp. All you need to do is allow mod_rewrite and put the project on your server. Then, you can access it by simply going to it's URL, for example

```
http://localhost/pos/
```
